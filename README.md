# Module 14: NY Citibike with Tableau

## Overview of the Analysis

### Summary
A bike trip analysis for New York City was completed to convince investors to invest in a bike-sharing program in Des Moines, Iowa. For this analysis, the 'tripduration' column in the dataset was first converted into the correct datatype (datetime). Then, a total of five additional visualizations were created to analyze the bike checkout times, the bike trips for each hour of each day, and the bike trips for each user type. Finally, these visualizations were assembled into a Tableau story for presenting.

## Results
For the month of August in 2019, there were a total of **2,344,224** rides. A large majority of these rides occurred in the midtown and lower areas of Manhattan. More than **80%** of the users were annual subscribers while less than **20%** were short-term customers. Of all the riders, approximately **65%** were male, **25%** were female, and the rest unknown. These statistics demonstrate that more NYC residents are using CitiBike to travel in the mid-to-lower Manhattan region than short-term travellers.
Since the majority of businesses are in that region, workers are likely using CitiBike to travel short distances rather than taking the subway. Recognizing that the majority of rides are located in the mid-to-lower Manhattan area also identifies the region that would require the most maintenance in the future.
