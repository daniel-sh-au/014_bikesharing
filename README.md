# Module 14: NY Citibike with Tableau

## Overview of the Analysis

### Summary
A bike trip analysis for New York City was completed to convince investors to invest in a bike-sharing program in Des Moines, Iowa. For this analysis, the 'tripduration' column in the dataset was first converted into the correct datatype (datetime). Then, a total of five additional visualizations were created to analyze the bike checkout times, the bike trips for each hour of each day, and the bike trips for each user type. Finally, these visualizations were assembled into a Tableau story for presenting.
